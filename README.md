# Attendance Tracking with Facial Recognition using FaceAPI.js

## Overview
This project aims to provide a solution for attendance tracking in educational institutions using facial recognition technology. Instead of traditional biometric scanners, this system allows teachers to use their web browsers to take a group of students and mark their attendance using a face recognition model.

## Features
- Mark attendance using facial recognition through a web browser.
- Easy integration with mobile phones for on-the-go attendance tracking.
- Quick setup and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- Django
- [FaceAPI.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/)
- Mobile device camera for image capture


## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Senthilsk10/face_Recognition.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd face_recognition_app
   ```
3. Start the server using the `manage.py` file in the command line:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
4. Create a set of users and a staff. Use staff to create a session and go into the session detail page.

5. Before proceeding, ensure that the `labels` folder in our folder structure contains labeled photos of users, i.e., students.

6. In the session, click "Take Photo" to add attendance. It will redirect you to another page. Wait for a few seconds for the model to load.

7. Once the model is loaded, you can repeatedly take photos and upload them to the page.

8. The backend will store the users identified as attendees for the session.

9. Data can be viewed on the details page of the session.

## Usage
  Open the web application in a mobile browser.
  Allow the application to access your device's camera.
  Teachers can:
    Click on "Take Attendance" to start the attendance process.
    Capture images of students' faces using the camera.
    Mark attendance for the group.
    View  records.
